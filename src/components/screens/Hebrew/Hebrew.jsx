              Many Shemite (inclusive of Black African American) young people
              are lost because they do not know their true history. The Torah,
              the Book of Instructions, has been falsely classified by some to
              be a book that is inscribed by man. Consequently, there is a
              growing acceptance in the world that the Torah/Bible came by an
              evolutionary process (to nullify the existence of Yah rather than
              believing the inerrant Word of Yahovah). Our communities are
              running rampant with occultism, cultic religions, crime, Islamic
              and other false religious persuasions. When we read and study the
              Tanak, we can trace our roots from Kingship and ultimately our
              fall into bondage.(see Deuteronomy 28:16-68) When we return to
              Yahshua, (Jesus)and repent of our sins and iniquities, our eyes
              will be open to Torah/Biblical truths, and we shall then discover
              the true rich heritage Yah bestowed upon us. We are the seed of
              Abraham, we are blessed and we are to be a blessing. We are
              victors and not victims. We should be givers and not just takers.
              We cannot discover who we are just through the civil rights
              movement, political parties or Kwanzaa etc. Yah is not looking at
              color but at criteria. Knowledge, truth grace, and mercy come by
              the Messiah, Yahshua.

            Isaiah 11:9-12 says: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
            mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD,
            as the waters cover the sea. And in that day there shall be a root
            of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall
            the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious. And it shall come
            to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the
            second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be
            left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush,
            and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the
            islands of the sea. And he shall set up an ensign for the nations,
            and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the
            dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.” Through
            theTorah, we can trace our roots to the tribe of Judah.

            Today we hear that many ancestral people are celebrating the Feasts.
            There is a growing momentum within the groins of our people who are
            recognizing we were not just slaves and disenfranchised people in a
            strange land, but a people who came out of a chosen group, to “show
            forth the praises of Him who has called us out of darkness into the
            marvelous light”. We are recognizing there is something about these
            “Feasts of the Lord” though we may not know or understand the whole
            context. Acts 8:27 gives us understanding that our people knew the
            true and living God by the record of this scriptures. “And he arose
            and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great
            authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge
            of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,”.
            Psalm 68:31 declares “Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia
            shall soon stretch out her hands unto God”. Many, many Scriptures
            show us not as savages but as worshippers. Read and understand to
            “Discover the Hebrew in you!”
