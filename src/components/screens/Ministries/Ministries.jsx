          Building the Body of the Mashiach through ministry to Men” Our mission
          is to present every man with a credible offer of the Gospel, encourage
          them to pursue YHWH, live a Biblical life of moral integrity and equip
          them for spiritual service in the home, church, workplace
          <p>
            Our goals are two-fold: A. To identify and equip at least one man in
            every willing BEICM Ministry who wants to build a disciple-making
            ministry to men through weekly meetings. B. And that there is a
            men’s ministry group in every BEICM affiliate Ministry/ Church E

      <h3>S.F.G</h3>
        <p>
          Do you try to fit Yeshua into your schedule? Or do you work your
          schedule around Yeshua? God cannot fit into our plans, we must fit
          into His ​ 1 Corinthians 7:32 Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) 32 What I
          want is for you to be free of concern. An unmarried man concerns
          himself with the Lord’s affairs, God is alive on His terms in a way
          that exceeds our experience and imagination. Yehovah has a special
          place in the work of His kingdom for single believers. However, being
          single have been veiwed as being 2nd best to being married. Nothing
          could be further from the truth. As singles, we have the unique
          opportnity to advance the kingdom without any distractions. Please
          join us starting April 1, 2019 for the SFG Challenge. We will for the
          next six months look to experience Yehovah on His terms. We challenge
          all single believers to focus on nothing else but the of Yehovahs
          kingdom! Join us live with other single believers for a word of
          encouragement, exhortation and our single commentators to explore what
          it means to be Single for God.. ​ "Do set your #goals high though, but
          be ready to work diligently at it. Keep #Godfirst no matter what and
          be ready to go through because for every #success stories, there are
          struggles. And when you're trying to live right by Him, here comes
          trouble, but it's so much better to live a righteous life and go
          through for Him, so that your soul shall live and have the eternal
          life promised...." Ms. "Jojo "Pierre
